PART 1: JUPYTER NOTEBOOK (COPY THIS)
Title: Task 1 – Understanding Dataset & Data Types
1. Import Required Libraries
Copy code
Python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
2. Load the Dataset (Titanic Dataset)
Copy code
Python
df = pd.read_csv("titanic.csv")
(If using Google Colab, upload titanic.csv first)
3. Display First and Last Records
Copy code
Python
df.head()
Copy code
Python
df.tail()
Observation:
The dataset contains passenger details such as age, sex, ticket class, fare, etc.
4. Dataset Shape and Columns
Copy code
Python
df.shape
Copy code
Python
df.columns
Observation:
Number of rows: 891
Number of columns: 12
5. Dataset Information (Data Types & Missing Values)
Copy code
Python
df.info()
Observation:
Numerical columns: Age, Fare, SibSp, Parch
Categorical columns: Sex, Embarked
Missing values found in Age, Cabin, and Embarked columns
6. Statistical Summary
Copy code
Python
df.describe()
Observation:
This gives statistical information such as mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation for numerical columns.
7. Identify Feature Types
Numerical Features
Age
Fare
SibSp
Parch
Categorical Features
Sex
Embarked
Ticket
Cabin
Binary Features
Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Ordinal Features
Pclass (1st class, 2nd class, 3rd class)
8. Check Unique Values in Categorical Columns
Copy code
Python
df['Sex'].unique()
Copy code
Python
df['Embarked'].unique()
Copy code
Python
df['Pclass'].unique()
Observation:
Categorical columns have limited unique values, suitable for encoding.
9. Identify Target Variable
Target Variable: Survived
Input Features: Age, Sex, Pclass, Fare, SibSp, Parch, Embarked
10. Dataset Size & ML Suitability
Observation:
Dataset has 891 records which is sufficient for basic machine learning models
Suitable for classification problems
11. Data Quality Issues
Missing values in Age and Cabin columns
Cabin column has many null values
Class imbalance in Survived column
12. Conclusion
The Titanic dataset is well-structured and suitable for machine learning after handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

PART 2: DATASET ANALYSIS REPORT (1 PAGE)
Dataset Understanding and Data Types Analysis
1. Dataset Overview
The Titanic dataset contains information about 891 passengers with 12 attributes. It includes demographic details, travel class, fare, and survival status.
2. Types of Features
Numerical Features: Age, Fare, SibSp, Parch
Categorical Features: Sex, Embarked, Ticket, Cabin
Binary Feature: Survived
Ordinal Feature: Pclass
3. Data Quality Issues
The dataset contains missing values in the Age, Cabin, and Embarked columns. The Cabin column has a high number of null values and may need to be dropped or processed. The target variable shows slight imbalance between survived and non-survived passengers.
4. Target Variable
The target variable is Survived, which indicates whether a passenger survived (1) or not (0).
5. Machine Learning Suitability
The dataset is suitable for machine learning classification tasks. With proper preprocessing such as handling missing values and encoding categorical variables, predictive models can be built effectively.
6. Conclusion
This dataset provides a good foundation for understanding data types, structure, and preprocessing steps required before applying machine learning algorithms.
