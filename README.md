Internship Task 1 – Dataset Understanding
Objective
The goal of this task is to understand the dataset, identify different data types, and check whether the data is suitable for machine learning.
Tools Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
Dataset
Titanic Dataset
This dataset contains information about passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and survival status.
Work Done
Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
Displayed first and last few rows of the dataset.
Checked number of rows and columns.
Identified data types of each column.
Found missing values in the dataset.
Generated basic statistical summary.
Classified features into:
Numerical
Categorical
Binary
Ordinal
Identified the target variable.
Checked dataset suitability for machine learning.
Target Variable
Survived (0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived)
Observations
Some columns have missing values.
Cabin column has many null values.
Dataset size is enough for basic machine learning models.
Machine Learning Suitability
The dataset is suitable for machine learning after basic data preprocessing like handling missing values and encoding categorical columns.
